# This project has been depreceiated by WinFor-Salt

Due to some of the constraints in managing the source URL's in Powershell, I'd like to link to the great work by @digitalsleuth - https://github.com/digitalsleuth/winfor-salt as per PR #38 we have reached feature parity there.


## KNOWN ISSUES

### Choco packages that are broken [#18](../../issues/18)
 regripper- Maintainer Contacted - (Also part of autospy)
 nimi places not launching, may not show tools by category. All shortcuts are under Forensics tools on the desktop
 

### Package issues

- [ ] Dcode DCode-x86-EN-5.2.20195.4.exe seems to be crashing on launch in a VM. Developer contacted

### Nimi Places
Shortcuts may not be showing in category with nimi places. A workaround can be conducted by changing your profile directory username and user directory to `user` i.e `C:\users\user\`

## Announcements

Initial WSL2 Implimentation
Initial GUI Implimentation

### In Development

GUI Replication that categorises each tool, similar to the Windows SIFT VM.
Implimentation of further tools upon request.

### Feedback / tool Requests

Please raise an issue for extra tools. Or, reopen #17

See [#32](https://github.com/angry-bender/forensicssetup/issues/32)
## Description

An open source project aimed to replicate the Windows SIFT Machine used during SANS Courses minus any payware software. This aims to install the same tools forensics analysts have trained with during their SANS Course, or to quickly prepare for a CTF, as there does not appear to be a similar VM available Open Source.
